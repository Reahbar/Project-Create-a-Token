# Project: Create a Token

This Solidity program is a simple "Token" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point of Token contract for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

## Description

This program is a simple contract of Token written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract is made as per requirments which is defined inside the smart contract. This program have 3 State veribles which are: string,string, and uint with the value of TokenName, TokenAbbrv, and TotoalSupply. This contract is defined with mapping(address=>uint) and it have two functions mint and burn with if condition inside the burn function. The function mint takes 2 inputs which is address _address and uint _value which works increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount. The function burn works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address. Lastly burn function have a condition of if to make sure the balance of account is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned.  

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Token.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

### Code

pragma solidity 0.8.18;

/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

contract MyToken { 

    // public variables here
    string public TokenName ="IndianNationalRupee"; 

    string public TokenAbbrv = "INR"; //

    uint public TotalSupply = 0; 

    // mapping variable here
    mapping (address => uint) public balances; 

    // mint function

    function mint (address _address, uint _value) public {    

        TotalSupply += _value;  

        balances [_address] += _value; 
    }

    // burn function

    function burn (address _address, uint _value) public {

        if (balances [_address] >= _value) {

            TotalSupply -= _value; 
            
            balances [_address] -= _value; 
        }
        
    }


}
```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.
